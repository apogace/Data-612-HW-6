First, I selected the baseball salary dataset for this assignment, focusing on the salary column. 
Then I checked to see if the salary column had any missing values that would require attention. It did not, so I proceeded after counting how many samples were in the column. 
Next, I created the new salary cleaned column for my analysis. 
At this point in the homework is where I ran into problems. 
I set up my function for each of the analyses I was going to perform.
I tried to use the sum function but kept getting error messages saying I could not iterate my values. 
I fixed this using the NumPy functions of mean, median, and sum, but this just gave me the same column back. 
Ultimately, after consulting the lecture notes, I could not use the apply keyword in my functions in any meaningful way.
